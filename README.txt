LJPics
======

LJPics is a service to retrieve LiveJournal userpics with a consistent URL
interface. Think of it as a Gravatar service for LiveJournal. I intend this
primarily for folks backing up their LiveJournal accounts elsewhere who
would like to display userpics alongside comments.

The Web.py-based implementation requires Web.py 0.3 and has been tested
against an SQLite backend.

An Appspot-based implementation is forthcoming. Hosting at Appspot will
free me from bandwidth concerns as the service's usage grows.
